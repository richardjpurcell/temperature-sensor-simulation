# Temperature Simulation with Transducer

This project simulates the temperature at a specific location `(x, y)` over time, using a sine wave model to represent daily fluctuations. It also simulates a transducer capturing temperature data at a configurable sampling rate. The application includes an interactive visualization of the simulated and captured temperature data.

## Features

- **Temperature Simulation**: Simulates temperature based on a sine wave model with user-configurable daily minimum and maximum temperatures.
- **Transducer Simulation**: Captures temperature samples based on a user-defined sampling rate (samples per day).
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays:
  - Simulated temperature over time.
  - Transducer-captured data over time.
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - Daily minimum temperature.
  - Daily maximum temperature.
  - Transducer sampling rate (samples per day).
